            Hey there! My name is Lucas Vogel, I am a Student Athlete at Menlo School and am on the varsity teams for Boys Lacrosse and Basketball. I have been a 4 year varsity player in both Lacrosse and Basketball, and have earned 1st team all league selections in both sports. Other than sports, I am also kind of a nerd. I love computer science and have learned languages like Java, Html, CSS, and Python. I also love Physics and chemisty and have taken AP classes in both of those sciences. On the non-academic side of school, I am Activities Coordinator and Sea of Gold Captain, which requires me to lead spirirt actvities at lunches and assembelies and also leading big cheers infront of packed student sections. Overal as a person, I value family and friend time and love playing with my dog Cruz.
